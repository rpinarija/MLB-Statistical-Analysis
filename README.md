# MLB-Statistical-Analysis
The main goal of this project was to see if there were any positions that are more impactful than others. Many statistics were taken into account, but WAR (Wins Above Replacement) was the focal point of the analysis. All data was compiled from fangraphs.com. Both R and Excel were used to compile and transform the data from fangraphs. Statistical methods included multiple linear regression, repeated K fold cross validation, and bootstrapping.
